Population health and health equity implications of a Medicaid-facilitated transitional care policy bundle for individuals released from incarceration in the United States: a microsimulation and cost-effectiveness analysis

1. Study Design:
   - The study will use a microsimulation model to estimate the implications of implementing the HHS-recommended transitional care bundle for individuals released from prisons or jails in the United States.
   - The model will simulate the health outcomes and healthcare utilization of released individuals over a ten-year period, comparing the current state of care with the proposed bundle of interventions.
2. Data Sources:
   - The study will use national data from various sources, including the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the Transitions Clinic Network.
   - Data will be subdivided by state (including Washington DC), and by the age, sex, and race/ethnicity categories available from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Other).
3. Study Population Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:
   - The study population will be limited to individuals released from federal prisons and local jails, excluding deaths in prisons and jails.
   - A sensitivity analysis will be performed including only the prison population to identify implications of a federal mandate for the HHS-recommended interventions without associated local-level changes.
4. Model Structure:
   - The microsimulation model will consist of several modules, including:
     - Population module: Simulates the population size and demographic characteristics of individuals released from prisons or jails.
     - Health outcomes module: Estimates the health outcomes of released individuals, including mortality, morbidity, and quality of life.
     - Healthcare utilization module: Simulates healthcare utilization patterns, including emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and outpatient services.
     - Cost module: Estimates the costs of healthcare services, including Medicaid expenditures, out-of-pocket costs, and other healthcare-related expenses.
     - Intervention module: Simulates the impact of the HHS-recommended transitional care bundle on health outcomes, healthcare utilization, and costs.
5. Model Assumptions:
   - The model assumes that the implementation of the HHS recommendations will be uniform across all states, and that the parameters provided are representative of the broader incarcerated population.
6. Modeled Interventions:
   - Three interventions will be simulated:
     - Pre-release Medicaid coverage reinstatement from suspension at 90 days prior to release, with enablement of clinical service transitions from carceral health care institutions to community-based patient-centered medical homes, Medicaid Health Homes, or related comprehensive primary care facilities.
     - Substance use services offered in the correctional setting under Medicaid rules, including screening and medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder prior to release.
     - Support from Medicaid-funded community health workers and associated community-based care navigation teams to assist with access to services, crisis diversion programs, and medication access and adherence post-release.
7. Outcomes Simulated:
   - The study will simulate several outcomes, including:
     - Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with all-cause mortality and substance use-related overdose morbidity and mortality.
     - All-cause mortality rate.
     - Substance-use related overdose mortality rate.
     - Outpatient care utilization rate including primary care and behavioral health services.
     - Emergency department visit rate.
     - Hospitalization rate.
     - Hospitalization length of stay.
     - Recidivism rate to incarceration.
     - Health care costs.
     - Total societal costs including incarceration costs.
8. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis:
   - The study will perform cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness of the bundle of modeled interventions in isolation and in concert.
   - The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be computed in terms of both health care expenditures alone and in total societal expenditures (including incarceration costs), over a 10-year policy planning horizon.
