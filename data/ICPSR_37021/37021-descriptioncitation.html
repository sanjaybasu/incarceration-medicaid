		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Alternate Title:</strong> NCRP 1991-2016</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) compiles offender-level data on admissions and releases from state and federal prisons and post-confinement community supervision. The data are used to monitor the nation's correctional population and address specific policy questions related to recidivism, prisoner reentry, and trends in demographic characteristics of the incarcerated and community supervision populations. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has administered the NCRP since 1983. Abt Associates has served as the NCRP data collection agent since October 2010.
This version of the NCRP contains selected variables making it suitable for public release.</span></p>

ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Standardized missing values.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
