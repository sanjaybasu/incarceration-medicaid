This annual Bulletin reports the number of persons in State and Federal
prisons at yearend, compares the increase in the prison population during
1999 with that of the previous year, and gives the growth rates since 1990.
It also includes the number of male and female prisoners; the incarceration
rates for States; and data on prison capacities and use of local jails,
privately operated prisons, and Federal and other State facilities to house
inmates. The report examines factors accounting for the continuing growth
in the State prison population.

prisons at yearend. It compares the increase in the prison population
during 1994 with that of the previous year and gives the 5- and 10-year
growth rates. The Bulletin reports the number of male and female prisoners,

Presents statistics for adults who were convicted of a felony and sentenced
in State courts. The data were collected through a survey of a nationally
representative sample of State courts in 300 counties in 2004. The number
and characteristics (age, sex, race) of offenders who were sentenced to
prison, jail, or probation are reported for the 5 major offense categories.
Trends from 1994 to 2004 highlight the number of adults convicted of
felonies as well as the types of conviction offenses and sentence lengths
imposed.

Prisoners in 1997 reports the number of persons in State and Federal
prisons at yearend, compares the increase in the prison population during
1997 with that of the previous year, and gives the 5- and 10-year growth
rates. This annual Bulletin reports the number of male and female
prisoners, the incarceration rates for States, and data on prison
capacities and use of local jails because of prison crowding. Highlights
include the following: During 1997 the number of female prisoners rose by
6.2%, slightly greater than the increase in male prisoners (5.2%). At
yearend 1997, 79,624 women were in State or Federal prisons -- 6.4% of all
prison inmates. On December 31, 1997, State prisons were operating at
between 15% and 24% above capacity, while Federal prisons were operating at
19% above capacity. California (157,547), Texas (140,729), and the Federal
system (112,973) together held 1 in every 3 prisoners in the Nation.
Fifteen States, each holding fewer than 5,000 inmates, together held only
4% of the Nation's prisoners.

This new Urban Institute study provides an in-depth examination of the
growth patterns in the largest correctional system in the United States -
the US Bureau of Prisons. The number of prisoners age 50 or older
experienced a 330 percent increase from 1994 to 2011. The authors find that
the proportion of these older prisoners is expected to have an even steeper
growth curve in the near future and they may consume a disproportionately
large amount of the federal prison budget. Recommendations for policy and
research include expanding data-driven knowledge on older prisoners and
developing cost-effective management plans for them.

The variables used to compare statistics include regional variations,
gender, age, ethnicity, and offense type. On any given day, there are up to
100,000 juveniles in custody; of the 11,000 different facilities that might
hold juveniles, only 30 percent are specifically designed for youthful
offenders, while the remainder are adult jails, police lockups, and State
correctional institutions. The findings reported here show that the highest
rate of juveniles in custody is in the Western U.S., while the South has
the highest rate of juveniles in adult facilities. One-day counts of youths
in juvenile facilities indicate that minority youths have higher rates of
confinement than whites, and males higher rates than females. Females are
more likely to be confined for status offenses and as non- offenders.
Between 1977 and 1987, declining juvenile admissions to public facilities
were counterbalanced by a large increase in admissions to private juvenile
correctional facilities; the data also suggest that length of stay
increased during that period. Currently available data provide little
insight into key policy questions regarding length of confinement,
recidivism rates, and costs of various juvenile correctional alternatives.
The report examines data collected through national juvenile court
statistics and the National Survey of Youth in Custody. It recommends
upgrading national data on youths in custody by improving sampling
strategies, data collection techniques, and future data analysis
procedures. 16 tables, 6 figures, and 2 appendixes

offender-specific data in the report. Details are provided on admissions to
State prisons by admission type, sex, race, demographic characteristics;
releaseds from State prison by method of release, time served in prison,
and sentence lengths; the demographic and offense characteristics of first
entries to parole from State prison; and discharges from State parole,
including successful and unsuccessful discharges. Federal offenders are
also described in terms of their demographic characteristics, offenses,
sentence lengths, time served, method of parole discharge, and other
factors. Tables

This report contains data collected by the National Corrections Reporting
Program (NCRP) concerning all prison admissions and releases and parole
entries and discharges for calendar year 1992 in participating
jurisdictions. NCRP data cover prisoners admitted to or released from
custody regardless of the jurisdiction where the prisoner was sentenced.
This report includes only inmates with a sentence of more than 1 year
except where noted. Data address State prison admissions, releases, and
trends since 1988; State parole entries, discharges, and trends; and
prisoners, parolees, and trends, including demographic characteristics,
offenses, sentence length, and time served. The report is divided into two
sections. The first section briefly addresses methodology including, in
addition to reporting criteria, terms and definitions, offenses, and
technical and explanatory notes. The second section contains the collected
data in tabular form. A listing of other Bureau of Justice Statistics
reports also is included.

This report presents a new methodology using National Corrections Reporting
Program (NCRP) data to produce return-to-prison recidivism estimates. This
offender-based methodology uses longitudinal data to estimate recidivism
and produces estimates of offenders released over long periods rather than
specific release cohorts. Though each type of recidivism methodology is
suited to answer different criminal justice questions, scholars formerly
relied on the event-based approach alone. This report discusses how to
produce offender-based recidivism estimates and the circumstances in which
offender-based estimates are more appropriate, based on the type of policy
or research question.
